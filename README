                 a minimal url shortner application


    ~ What is Flaskly?

      A sqlite powered url shortner application. It
      is loosely based on the other example applications
      from flask.
      

    ~ How do I use it?

      1. edit the configuration in the flaskly.py file or
         export an FLASKLY_SETTINGS environment variable
         pointing to a configuration file.

      2. fire up a python shell and run this:

         >>> from flaskly import init_db; init_db()

      3. now you can run the flaskly.py file with your
         python interpreter and the application will
         greet you on http://localhost:5000/

    ~ Is it tested?

      No.
